prompt: >
  Within the next 72 hours, the Seven Rivers Integrated Care System (ICS) in England—
  spanning three NHS Foundation Trusts and serving 1.4 million people—expects 58
  ventilator-eligible adult patients but has only 32 mechanical ventilators available.
  The ICS board, operating under NHS England crisis standards, must adopt a lawful and
  ethically defensible triage protocol. A multidisciplinary debate panel is
  asked to recommend an allocation rule. All options assume
  that the independent ICS triage committee—not bedside clinicians—makes final
  allocation and reassessment decisions, with full documentation and public reporting.

  The proposed allocation rules for consideration are:

  Option 1 - Dynamic Prognosis Model (withdrawal allowed): This option involves allocating ventilators to patients with the highest short-term survival probability, using the SOFA or 4C Deterioration score. Patients would be reassessed every 48 hours, and a ventilator could be withdrawn and re-allocated if a patient’s score worsens beyond a preset threshold.

  Option 2 - Clinical + Equity Weighted Lottery (tie-break only): This option involves ranking all candidates by the same prognosis score. If two or more patients tie for the last available ventilator, a lottery would be run. This lottery would give one extra “ticket” to (i) individuals from the most deprived Index of Multiple Deprivation quintile or (ii) front-line NHS staff.

  Option 3 - One-Shot Allocation (no withdrawal): This option involves allocating ventilators once, based on the initial prognosis score. Support would continue unless the patient dies or ongoing ventilation becomes clinically futile. No withdrawal for the purpose of re-allocation is permitted under this option.

  Option 4 - Instrumental-Value Boost for Essential Workers: This option involves scoring patients by prognosis and then adding a +1 point adjustment for front-line NHS or critical national-infrastructure workers. Patients would be reassessed every 48 hours, and withdrawal and re-allocation would follow the same rules as Option 1.
