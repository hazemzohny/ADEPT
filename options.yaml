# CASE: Ventilator triage during COVID-19 surge – allocating scarce ICU capacity

case: covid_ventilator_triage
prompt: >
  A regional health-care consortium is operating under “crisis standards of care” during a
  severe COVID-19 wave.  Available intensive-care ventilators are projected to be outstripped
  by need within 48 hours.  Hospitals have agreed in principle to a shared triage protocol,
  but remain divided over the ethical framework.  Proposals range from strict utilitarian
  maximisation of life-years saved, to egalitarian lottery systems, to adjustments that protect
  persons with disabilities or from historically disadvantaged communities.  Families, front-
  line clinicians, and disability-rights organisations are watching closely.  The debate
  centres on: (i) what counts as a fair allocation principle under emergency scarcity,
  (ii) how to operationalise any scoring algorithm across multiple hospitals, and (iii) how
  transparent or insulated the triage team should be from bedside staff.

options:
  # Option 1: Maximise lives-saved through a clinical survivability score.
  - Allocate ventilators to patients with the highest short-term survival probability,
    using a SOFA-based scoring system that is recalculated every 24 hours; re-allocate
    devices away from patients whose scores worsen below a preset threshold.

  # Option 2: Protect equity via a weighted lottery.
  - Apply a simple lottery among all ventilator candidates, but give extra chances (e.g.,
    one additional “ticket”) to individuals from communities with historically poorer
    health outcomes or to essential workers.

  # Option 3: First-come, first-served with no re-allocation.
  - Admit patients to ventilators strictly in the order in which they present and meet
    minimal eligibility, and continue support unless they progress to brain death or
    their authorised surrogate requests withdrawal.

  # Option 4: Cross-hospital resource pooling and escalation review panel.
  - Create a regional command centre that actively transfers patients and ventilators
    among hospitals to equalise load; final triage decisions are made by a standing
    multi-disciplinary panel that includes a disability advocate and ethicist.
