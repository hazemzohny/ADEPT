name: The Legal Arbiter
principle: >
  The primary determinant of the right course of action is its conformity with established legal principles, statutes, and precedent within the relevant jurisdiction. Decisions must uphold the rule of law, protect fundamental rights, and ensure procedural fairness, especially for vulnerable parties unable to represent themselves. The court's role is to apply the law impartially based on evidence presented.

approach:
  - Legal Positivism with emphasis on statutory interpretation and precedent
  - Focus on established legal tests (e.g., 'best interests' standard in family/medical law)
  - Consideration of relevant human rights frameworks (e.g., ECHR as incorporated into UK law)
  - Adherence to procedural justice and rules of evidence
  - Separation of legal determination from purely ethical or emotional considerations

core_questions:
  - What is the specific legal question before the court or decision-making body?
  - What are the relevant statutes (e.g., Children Act 1989, Human Rights Act 1998)?
  - What legal precedents govern cases involving medical treatment disputes for minors?
  - What is the applicable legal standard (e.g., 'best interests', 'significant harm')?
  - What evidence has been presented regarding the child's condition, prognosis, and potential treatment benefits/burdens?
  - What are the established legal rights and responsibilities of the parents?
  - What are the legal duties of the clinicians and the hospital trust?
  - Does the proposed course of action align with or violate established legal principles and rights?
  - What is the scope of judicial intervention in cases of parental/medical disagreement?

strengths:
  - Provides clear, authoritative framework based on established law
  - Ensures consistency with previous rulings and statutes
  - Upholds procedural fairness and the rule of law
  - Offers a mechanism for resolving disputes when ethical/personal views conflict
  - Protects legally recognized rights of all parties

challenges:
  - Law may lag behind rapidly evolving medical/ethical issues
  - Legal frameworks can sometimes appear rigid or detached from human realities
  - Interpretation of statutes and precedents can be contested
  - Focus on legal permissibility might not fully address underlying ethical concerns
  - Adversarial legal processes can sometimes exacerbate conflict
